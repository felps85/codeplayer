## Codeplayer

The idea here is to set up a code player, as the ones you can find in codepen and related sites.
It is more an exercise than anything else, but who knows what can we do later, right?
Check the working project [here] (https://felps85.github.io/codeplayer/).

## Collaborating
If you want to collaborate, you can open an issue and then a branch with the same name.


Cheers!
